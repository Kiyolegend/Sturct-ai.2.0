"""
Narrative Engine — translates raw market structure analysis into plain-English commentary.

IMPORTANT DESIGN CHANGE (per product decision):
This engine no longer classifies a market "condition" (Bullish Pullback, Range,
Expansion, etc.) and it no longer tells the trader WHERE to enter, WHAT level to
watch, or WHAT to wait for. Finding the entry is the trader's job.

Instead this engine answers one question: "what trading style does the current
structure support right now?" — Scalping, Intraday Trade, Swing Trade, and/or
Trend Exhaustion (a caution state, not a style to trade). More than one can be
true at once, and if so, all of them are reported.

Accuracy note on "Trend Exhaustion": this engine only has visibility into the
recent swing structure pulled from the analysis window (roughly the last
handful of 4H/1H/15M swings). It cannot know true multi-year/all-time highs or
lows. Exhaustion here means "relative to the recent swing structure this
engine can see" — described that way everywhere it's surfaced, not as an
absolute all-time extreme claim.

No market data is fetched here — this is a pure transformation function.
