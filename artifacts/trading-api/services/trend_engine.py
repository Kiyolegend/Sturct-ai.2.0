"""
Trend Engine.

Determines the current trend based on the MOST RECENTLY CONFIRMED structure labels.

Professional market structure definition:
  Bullish  → last confirmed HIGH label is HH  AND last confirmed LOW label is HL
  Bearish  → last confirmed HIGH label is LH   AND last confirmed LOW label is LL
  Neutral  → mixed signals (e.g. HH + LL, or LH + HL — a transition/flip is forming)

This is the textbook ICT / Wyckoff / Smart Money definition of trend based on
swing structure. It uses only the most recent confirmed swing of each kind,
giving zero weight to older labels, which ensures the bias reflects the current
market state rather than a lagging average.

    Analyse structure labels to determine trend direction.

    Confidence scoring:
      - Both labels agree (e.g. HH + HL)  → 100
        BUT if the agreeing pair is recent within the last 4 labels → 100
        AND if the agreeing pair is from older labels (5-6 back) → 75
        This rewards fresh structure over stale structure.
      - Mixed signals                       → 50 (neutral)
