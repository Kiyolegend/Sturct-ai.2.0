Structure Classification Engine.

Classifies each swing point as:
  HH - Higher High  (swing high > previous swing high)
  HL - Higher Low   (swing low  > previous swing low)
  LH - Lower High   (swing high < previous swing high)
  LL - Lower Low    (swing low  < previous swing low)

Labels are only assigned at zig-zag swing points.
Requires at least 2 prior swings of the same kind to assign a label.
